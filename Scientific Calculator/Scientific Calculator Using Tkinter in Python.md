Title: Scientific Calculator Using Tkinter in Python

Description:
    This project is a Scientific Calculator developed using the Tkinter library in Python. It is designed to handle both basic arithmetic operations and more advanced mathematical functions, such as trigonometric calculations and square root operations. The calculator features a simple and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI), making it accessible for users ranging from students to professionals who require a reliable tool for their computational needs.

Features:
    Basic Arithmetic Operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.
    Scientific Functions: Sine, Cosine, Tangent (in degrees), and Square Root.
    Responsive GUI: The calculator window and buttons are designed to adjust based on the window size.
    Error Handling: Provides feedback for invalid inputs or expressions.
    Clear and Backspace Functions: Allows users to clear the input or remove the last character

Usage:
    Basic Operations: Click on the numerical and operation buttons to form an expression, and press = to evaluate.
    Scientific Operations: Use the sin, cos, tan, and sqrt buttons for advanced calculations.
    Clearing Input: Press C to clear the entire input, or âŒ« to remove the last character.
